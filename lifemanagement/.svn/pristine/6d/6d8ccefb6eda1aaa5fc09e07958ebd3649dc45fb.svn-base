You can use javascript to access the parent. You could echo out javascript in your PHP.. so your parent page has this:

function changeURL( url ) { 
    document.location = url; 
} 
and in your php script, you echo 

<script> 
   parent.changeURL('mypage2.html' ); 
</script> 
The reason you can't call parent.document.location is because it's read only - you have to have a function available on the parent to do it.
